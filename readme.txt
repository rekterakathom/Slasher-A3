The Slasher Arma 3 project is open source. This means anyone can fork and commit to the mission in GitHub.

3den enhanced is an editing dependency, if the mission is edited without it, certain aspects of the mission will be affected.
Mainly the static hunters.

TODO list
1. Hunter damage script, to not rely on 3den enhanced
2. More maps (allow players to pick different maps in the parameters?)
